# Module Eight Journal
## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
It depends on what my role is. If I am the product owner, I talk to users to understand their needs and document them in user stories with clear acceptance criteria.
If I am a developer, I would review the user stories that were created by the product owner, understand the acceptance criteria and utilize my expertise in the technology stack to build the features asked for in the user story.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Developing programs is one of the steps in problem solving. I approach them by identifying the problem, brainstorming solutions, choosing the most viable solution, identifying cost and assumptions, validating assumptions and then implementing. 
An agile practice worth using while doing the above is periodically checking in with whoever I am solving the problem for and demoing work in progress.
